# Number Guessing Game (Python)

A fun **number guessing game** I made while learning Python.  
The computer chooses a random number between 1 and 100, and you try to guess it within a limited number of tries.  
The game gives hints depending on how close your guess is, making it more exciting and interactive.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script.
2. Choose a difficulty mode from Easy to Impossible.
3. Enter your guesses.
4. The game will tell you if you're:
   - Extremely close  
   - Very close  
   - Close  
   - Or if you need to go higher or lower
5. Keep track of your **streaks** and try to beat them!

After each game, you can **play again or quit**.
